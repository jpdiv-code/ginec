Basic concepts:
* Virtual CPU is a virtual machine that executes the game code. It does not have its own memory, registers or stack.
* A cartridge is an array of 4-byte values stored in a file or in RAM. Game resources and code, virtual CPU and game states are stored on the cartridge.
* The system is an executor that provides input (keyboard, mouse or gamepad) and output (graphics and sounds) functions.
